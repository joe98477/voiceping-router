<objective>
Create load testing scripts for 100 concurrent users, build an end-to-end test page for Phase 2 features (permission checks, dispatch priority, emergency broadcast, force-disconnect), and verify all Phase 2 success criteria. This is the final verification plan.

Purpose: Validate that the entire Phase 2 system works under load and all success criteria are met before declaring the phase complete.
Output: Load test scripts, E2E test page, verified success criteria.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create load test script for 100 concurrent users</name>
  <files>
    src/server/test/loadTest.ts
  </files>
  <action>
Create src/server/test/loadTest.ts that simulates 100 concurrent users connecting to the WebSocket server.

**Load Test Script:**

1. **JWT token generation:** Create a helper function that generates valid JWT tokens for test users. Use the same ROUTER_JWT_SECRET from config. Generate tokens with:
   - userId: `test-user-{N}` (N = 1 to 100)
   - userName: `Test User {N}`
   - eventId: `test-event-1`
   - role: Mix of roles (80 GENERAL, 15 DISPATCH, 5 ADMIN per the realistic distribution)
   - channelIds: Assign users to channels (10 channels, ~10 users each)

2. **Redis setup:** Before the test, seed Redis with the user-channel mappings matching the JWT claims. Use the control-plane's key pattern: `u.{userId}.g` set with channel IDs, and `g.{channelId}.u` set with user IDs.

3. **Test phases:**
   a. **Connection phase:** Connect all 100 users over 10 seconds (10 per second ramp-up to avoid thundering herd). Measure connection time, success rate.
   b. **Channel join phase:** Each user joins their assigned channels. Measure join latency, permission check overhead.
   c. **PTT load phase:** Simulate PTT activity -- 10% of users start PTT simultaneously across different channels. Measure lock acquisition time.
   d. **Dispatch priority phase:** One Dispatch user uses priority PTT to interrupt a General user. Measure interrupt latency.
   e. **Permission revocation phase:** Revoke 5 users' channel access via Redis (simulating control-plane action) and verify they're removed within 30 seconds (heartbeat interval).
   f. **Disconnect phase:** Gracefully disconnect all users. Measure cleanup time.

4. **Metrics collection:**
   - Connection success rate (target: 100%)
   - Average connection time (target: < 500ms)
   - Average channel join time (target: < 200ms)
   - Average PTT lock acquisition time (target: < 50ms)
   - Dispatch priority interrupt time (target: < 100ms)
   - Memory usage before/after connections
   - Redis operation count

5. **Output:** Print test results to console in a clear table format. Include PASS/FAIL for each metric.

6. **Run command:** Add a script to package.json: `"test:load": "npx tsx src/server/test/loadTest.ts"`

The script should be runnable standalone: `npm run test:load` assumes the server is already running on localhost:3000.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify compilation. Verify the script file exists and can be parsed. Run `npm run test:load` against a running server to execute the test (requires Docker environment running).
  </verify>
  <done>
Load test script simulates 100 concurrent users with realistic role distribution. Tests connection, channel join, PTT, dispatch priority, permission revocation. Collects metrics and reports PASS/FAIL. Runnable via npm run test:load.

  <name>Task 2: Create E2E test page for Phase 2 feature verification</name>
  <files>
    src/client/test/e2e-phase2.ts
  </files>
  <action>
Create src/client/test/e2e-phase2.ts -- a browser-based test page (similar to Phase 1's test demo page) that allows manual verification of all Phase 2 features.

**Test Page Layout:**

Three panels side by side:
- Panel 1: Admin User (global admin role)
- Panel 2: Dispatch User (dispatch role in test event)
- Panel 3: General User (general role in test event)

Each panel has:
- Connection status indicator (connected/disconnected)
- Role badge (ADMIN/DISPATCH/GENERAL)
- Channel list showing authorized channels with join/leave buttons
- PTT button (for channels they've joined)
- Status log (scrolling text area showing all signaling messages)

**Dispatch Panel extras:**
- Priority PTT button (distinct from regular PTT)
- Emergency Broadcast button (with visual 2-second hold indicator)
- Force Disconnect button (select target user from dropdown of connected users)

**Admin Panel extras:**
- Force Disconnect button
- Ban/Unban user controls

**Test Scenarios to verify manually:**

1. **Permission enforcement:** General user tries to join a channel they're not assigned to -- should fail
2. **Channel join:** General user joins an authorized channel -- should succeed
3. **PTT:** General user PTTs on joined channel -- should work
4. **Dispatch priority:** Dispatch user uses priority PTT while General is transmitting -- General should be interrupted
5. **Emergency broadcast:** Dispatch user holds emergency broadcast button for 2+ seconds -- should transmit to all channels
6. **Force disconnect:** Dispatch force-disconnects General user -- should immediately disconnect
7. **Permission revocation:** Remove General user's channel access (via separate Redis command) -- user should be removed within 30s
8. **Rate limiting:** Connect rapidly (>20 times/minute) -- should see progressive slowdown

**Token generation:** Include a simple form to generate JWT tokens with configurable userId, role, eventId, and channelIds. Use the existing token generation pattern from Phase 1's test page.

Build with esbuild (same pattern as Phase 1's test page): add a build script for the test bundle.

Serve the test page only in development mode (NODE_ENV !== 'production'), at path /test/phase2.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify compilation. Run the esbuild bundle command to verify the browser bundle builds. Start the server and visit https://localhost/test/phase2 to verify the page loads.
  </verify>
  <done>
E2E test page with Admin, Dispatch, and General user panels. Each panel has connection controls, channel list, PTT, and role-specific actions. Dispatch has priority PTT, emergency broadcast, force-disconnect. Admin has force-disconnect and ban/unban. Status logs show all signaling messages. Test page served at /test/phase2 in dev mode only.
  </done>

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 2: User Management and Access Control system including:
- Permission-checked channel join (General users restricted to assigned channels)
- Heartbeat-based permission refresh every 30 seconds
- Real-time permission sync via Redis pub/sub
- Dispatch PTT priority interrupt with interrupted user notification
- Emergency broadcast (2-second hold, all-channel override)
- Force-disconnect for Dispatch and Admin
- Ban/unban user management
- Progressive rate limiting (no hard lockout)
- Full audit logging
- Server-side jitter buffer configuration
- Worker pool optimization for 1000+ users

  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the Docker environment: `docker-compose up --build`
2. Visit https://localhost/test/phase2
3. **Test permission enforcement:**
   - Connect as General user with channelIds=['ch1']
   - Try to join 'ch2' -- should fail with "Not authorized"
   - Join 'ch1' -- should succeed
4. **Test Dispatch priority:**
   - Connect General user and start PTT on ch1
   - Connect Dispatch user and use Priority PTT on ch1
   - General user should be interrupted, Dispatch should be speaking
   - General panel should show "Dispatch [name] has priority"
5. **Test emergency broadcast:**
   - Connect Dispatch user
   - Hold Emergency Broadcast button for 2+ seconds
   - All channels should show Dispatch as speaker
   - Short press (< 2s) should be rejected
6. **Test force-disconnect:**
   - Connect General user
   - As Dispatch, force-disconnect the General user
   - General user should immediately disconnect
7. **Test load:**
   - Run `npm run test:load`
   - All 100 connections should succeed
   - Metrics should show PASS for all targets
8. **Verify all Phase 2 success criteria:**
   - [ ] Admin user can create events and assign users to roles (via control-plane)
   - [ ] Dispatch user can create teams/channels within assigned events (via control-plane)
   - [ ] Dispatch user can assign/remove users from channels (via control-plane, synced to router)
   - [ ] General user can only PTT on assigned channels (permission check at join)
   - [ ] Authorization checked before channel access (permission manager)
   - [ ] 100 concurrent users handled successfully (load test)
