    1. Enhance ConnectionBanner.kt to handle RECONNECTING and FAILED states:
       Per locked decisions:
       - Long disconnection (5+s): "Reconnecting..." banner slides down from top bar
       - Max retry timeout: "Connection lost" with Retry button
       - Banner text: Just "Reconnecting..." no attempt count or elapsed time

       Update the ConnectionBanner composable:
       - Accept additional `onRetry: () -> Unit` callback parameter.
       - **Banner timing per locked decisions (CRITICAL):**
         Brief drops (1-3s): NO banner shown. Long disconnection (5+s): banner slides down.
         Implement with a 5-second delay before showing the RECONNECTING banner:
         ```kotlin
         // Track when RECONNECTING state began
         var reconnectingSince by remember { mutableStateOf<Long?>(null) }
         var showBanner by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

         LaunchedEffect(connectionState) {
             if (connectionState == ConnectionState.RECONNECTING) {
                 if (reconnectingSince == null) {
                     reconnectingSince = System.currentTimeMillis()
                 }
                 // Wait 5 seconds before showing banner (brief drops stay silent)
                 delay(5000L)
                 // Still reconnecting after 5s? Show banner
                 if (connectionState == ConnectionState.RECONNECTING) {
                     showBanner = true
                 }
             } else if (connectionState == ConnectionState.FAILED) {
                 // FAILED always shows banner immediately (5-min timeout already elapsed)
                 showBanner = true
             } else {
                 // CONNECTED or other: hide banner, reset timer
                 showBanner = false
                 reconnectingSince = null
             }
         }
         ```
       - Show banner when `showBanner` is true (NOT directly from connectionState).
       - RECONNECTING state (after 5s delay): amber/warning background (secondaryContainer), text "Reconnecting..."
       - FAILED state: red/error background (errorContainer), text "Connection lost" with TextButton "Retry" at right side.
       - Use AnimatedVisibility with slideInVertically(initialOffset = { -it }) for slide-down animation.
       - Keep existing CONNECTING state behavior.
       - Use Row layout: Text on left, Retry button on right (only for FAILED).
       - Add appropriate padding (horizontal = 16.dp, vertical = 8.dp).

    2. Wire PTT error handling during reconnection/disconnected states:
       Per locked decision: "PTT stays interactive, error on press while disconnected. Do NOT gray out."
       - In ChannelRepository.startTransmission() (or the method that sends PTT_START to the server):
         At the top of the method, before sending PTT_START, check `signalingClient.connectionState.value`.
         If state is RECONNECTING, FAILED, or DISCONNECTED:
           - Call tonePlayer.playErrorTone() (existing method)
           - Call hapticFeedback.vibrateError() (existing method)
           - Do NOT send PTT_START to server (would fail anyway)
           - Log warning: "PTT press ignored: not connected (state=$currentState)"
           - Return early without starting transmission.
         If state is CONNECTED: proceed normally.
       - The PttButton composable remains always enabled (no visual graying out).
       - This guard is placed in ChannelRepository (not ChannelListViewModel) since ChannelRepository owns transmission signaling.

    3. Enhance BottomBar.kt to show offline badge:
       Per locked decision: "Bottom bar shows primary channel name with offline badge"
       - Accept `connectionState: ConnectionState` parameter.
       - When connectionState is RECONNECTING or FAILED or DISCONNECTED (and channels exist), show small badge text "(Offline)" next to channel name in secondary color (onSurfaceVariant or errorContainer color).
       - PTT button remains interactive (per locked decision: do NOT gray out or disable PTT).

    4. Enhance ChannelMonitoringService.kt notification for reconnection:
       Per locked decision: "Foreground notification keeps channel name, adds 'Reconnecting...' as subtitle"
       - Add EXTRA_IS_RECONNECTING = "extra_is_reconnecting" constant.
       - In ACTION_UPDATE_CHANNEL handler, read boolean extra for reconnecting state.
       - When reconnecting, set notification content text to "Reconnecting..." instead of "Monitoring".
       - When not reconnecting, keep existing "Monitoring" text.
       - Add updateReconnectionState(isReconnecting: Boolean) intent helper or use existing ACTION_UPDATE_CHANNEL with the new boolean extra.
  </action>
  <verify>
    cd android && ./gradlew compileDebugKotlin 2>&1 | tail -5
    Verify: ConnectionBanner shows "Reconnecting..." for RECONNECTING (after 5s delay), "Connection lost" + Retry for FAILED
    Verify: BottomBar accepts connectionState and shows offline badge
    Verify: ChannelMonitoringService supports EXTRA_IS_RECONNECTING in notification
    Verify: ChannelRepository.startTransmission() guards against PTT while disconnected
  </verify>
  <done>
    ConnectionBanner shows "Reconnecting..." banner after 5s of continuous disconnection (brief drops silent) and "Connection lost" with Retry button on failure. BottomBar shows offline badge when disconnected. Notification shows "Reconnecting..." subtitle. PTT press while disconnected triggers error tone + haptic, does not send to server.

    1. Add connection/disconnection tones to TonePlayer.kt:
       Per locked decisions:
       - Subtle up tone when connecting/reconnecting successfully
       - Down tone on disconnection
       - Respect existing tone toggle setting (silent if tones disabled)

       Add playConnectionTone() method:
       ```kotlin
       /**
        * Play connection established tone - subtle up chirp.
        * Tone: DTMF 9 (1477 Hz + 852 Hz) for 120ms
        * Configurable: Yes (respects PTT start tone toggle setting)
        */
       fun playConnectionTone() {
           try {
               if (settingsRepository.getCachedPttStartToneEnabled()) {
                   toneGenerator?.startTone(ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_9, 120)
                   Log.d(TAG, "Playing connection tone")
               }
           } catch (e: Exception) {
               Log.e(TAG, "Error playing connection tone", e)
           }
       }
       ```

       Add playDisconnectionTone() method:
       ```kotlin
       /**
        * Play disconnection tone - subtle down chirp.
        * Tone: DTMF 7 (1209 Hz + 852 Hz) for 150ms
        * Configurable: Yes (respects PTT start tone toggle setting)
        */
       fun playDisconnectionTone() {
           try {
               if (settingsRepository.getCachedPttStartToneEnabled()) {
                   toneGenerator?.startTone(ToneGenerator.TONE_DTMF_7, 150)
                   Log.d(TAG, "Playing disconnection tone")
               }
           } catch (e: Exception) {
               Log.e(TAG, "Error playing disconnection tone", e)
           }
       }
       ```

    2. Add transmission event haptic patterns to HapticFeedback.kt:
       Per locked decisions: "User feels haptic feedback for PTT press, release, busy, and transmission events"

       Existing patterns: vibratePttPress() (50ms firm click), vibrateError() (buzz-pause-buzz), vibrateRelease() (30ms subtle pulse).

       Add vibrateTransmissionStart() method:
       ```kotlin
       /**
        * Vibrate when incoming transmission starts - light pulse.
        * Pattern: Single pulse, 40ms duration, half amplitude
        * Purpose: Subtle tactile feedback someone started speaking
        */
       fun vibrateTransmissionStart() {
           try {
               if (vibrator?.hasVibrator() == true) {
                   val effect = VibrationEffect.createOneShot(40, VibrationEffect.DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE / 2)
                   vibrator.vibrate(effect)
                   Log.d(TAG, "Transmission start vibration triggered")
               }
           } catch (e: Exception) {
               Log.e(TAG, "Error vibrating on transmission start", e)
           }
       }
       ```

       Add vibrateBusy() method:
       ```kotlin
       /**
        * Vibrate when channel becomes busy - double tap pattern.
        * Pattern: Tap (30ms), pause (40ms), tap (30ms)
        * Purpose: Distinct "channel busy" feedback when user tries to PTT on occupied channel
        */
       fun vibrateBusy() {
           try {
               if (vibrator?.hasVibrator() == true) {
                   val timings = longArrayOf(0, 30, 40, 30)
                   val amplitudes = intArrayOf(0, 128, 0, 128)
                   val effect = VibrationEffect.createWaveform(timings, amplitudes, -1)
                   vibrator.vibrate(effect)
                   Log.d(TAG, "Channel busy vibration triggered")
               }
           } catch (e: Exception) {
               Log.e(TAG, "Error vibrating on busy channel", e)
           }
       }
       ```

    3. Wire connection tones and notification update in ChannelRepository.kt:
       Add connection state observation to ChannelRepository init block (or where appropriate):

       - Observe signalingClient.connectionState transitions:
         - Track `var disconnectedSinceMs: Long? = null` to measure disconnect duration.
         - When transitioning FROM CONNECTED to RECONNECTING or DISCONNECTED:
           Record disconnectedSinceMs = System.currentTimeMillis(). Do NOT play tone yet.
         - When transitioning TO ConnectionState.CONNECTED from RECONNECTING or CONNECTING:
           Check how long we were disconnected: `val duration = disconnectedSinceMs?.let { System.currentTimeMillis() - it }`.
           If duration != null && duration >= 5000: play tonePlayer.playConnectionTone() (was a long disconnect).
           If duration == null or duration < 5000: do NOT play tone (brief drop, silently resumed per locked decision).
           Reset disconnectedSinceMs = null.
         - **Disconnection tone with delayed check (aligns with banner 5s delay):**
           When state changes to RECONNECTING, launch a coroutine that delays 5 seconds. After delay, if still not CONNECTED, play tonePlayer.playDisconnectionTone(). This ensures brief drops (<5s) produce NO disconnection tone per locked decision "Brief drops silently resume."
         - Track previous state with a variable to detect transitions.

       - Add notification reconnecting state update:
         - When connectionState changes to RECONNECTING, send intent to ChannelMonitoringService with EXTRA_IS_RECONNECTING = true
         - When connectionState changes back to CONNECTED, send intent with EXTRA_IS_RECONNECTING = false

       - Wire vibrateTransmissionStart() into the existing speaker change observer:
         - When a new speaker starts on a monitored channel (currentSpeaker changes from null to non-null),
           call hapticFeedback.vibrateTransmissionStart() (only for incoming transmissions, not user's own).
         - This should be in the existing observeSpeakerChangesForChannel() method.

       - Wire vibrateBusy() to channel busy event:
         - In ChannelRepository, find the PTT press handling method (where channel busy/occupied is detected).
         - When user presses PTT and the channel is currently occupied by another speaker (busy state),
           call hapticFeedback.vibrateBusy() to give the distinct "channel busy" double-tap feedback.
         - Specifically: In the method handling PTT_START signaling response (or where CHANNEL_BUSY error is received),
           add `hapticFeedback.vibrateBusy()` alongside the existing error tone (playErrorTone).
         - If channel busy is detected in ChannelListViewModel.onPttPressed() instead, wire it there.
           The key location is wherever the "channel is busy" response from the server is processed after a PTT attempt.

       **Important:** Ensure HapticFeedback and TonePlayer are already injected in ChannelRepository. Check constructor. If not present, add them.
